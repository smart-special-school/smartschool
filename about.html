                        <h2>EMPOWERING ABILITIES,TRANSFORMING LIVES!</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Shine Mentally Challenged and Rehabilitation Trust was established in 2003 at Arakkonam,
                            Ranipet district, Tamilnadu in response to the growing need for specialized care and
                            education for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It started with only two children and very basic amenities. Despite the initial struggles
                            and minimal resources, the school gradually grew, serving more children from Arakkonam and
                            the surrounding areas. The school not only focused on providing education but also created a
                            nurturing environment where special children could thrive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the Trust evolved, it began to expand its services to meet the growing needs of the
                            children. Recognizing the importance of nutrition, the school started providing three
                            nutritious meals daily, along with two servings of milk and healthy snacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The need for a safe and secure environment became evident as the school encountered children
                            who were denied shelter. This led to the establishment of a facility that offered not just
                            education but also shelter, food, clothing, medicine, and vocational training to help these
                            children become more self-reliant.
